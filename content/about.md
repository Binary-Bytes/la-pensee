> “Make stuff you love and talk about stuff you love and you’ll attract people who love that kind of stuff. It’s that simple.” **―Austin Kleon, "Show Your Work!"**

Hello there, fellow reader, and welcome to **_la pensée_**.\
This blog is my little place on the internet where I would like to share my random musings, ideas and thoughts that I find interesting to ponder about. Some thoughts might be philosophical, others are just quirky, but all of them reflect the way I see the world.

I was heavily inspired by **Micheal Stevens** of **[Vsauce](https://www.youtube.com/@Vsauce)** and his way of looking at, and explaining things, and also I wanted a place to talk about the things I love the most — mainly technology.

###### why did i start this?

Partly because I was bored, partly because I was fed up from studying all the time, and mostly because it feels good to put my thoughts out there; after all, it's better than mindlessly scrolling on YouTube.\
Maybe in this way, I learn a thing or two about writing, and improve my English skills in the process.

For anyone wondering, the name **_la pensée_** comes from French, meaning **_"the thought"_**.\
Since I'm learning French in school, I simply chose it because I liked how it sounds, how it looks, and how it resonates with the purpose of this blog — a space to think and share.

With **_la pensée_**, I tried my best to achieve a minimalistic design with a focus on simplicity. I coded this website with **[HUGO](https://gohugo.io/)** and hosted it through **[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**. All text content is written in **[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)** and the logo is generated through **[Dicebear Editor](https://editor.dicebear.com/)**.

I want this blog to be a place where I can freely share my thoughts and ideas without any distractions. I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them.\
Stick around, read a bit, and maybe you'll find something interesting here too.

###### want to get in touch?

I'm a `"pretty boring person"` according to _some_, so I'm not sure why you would want to, but sure, I guess.
