Welcome to **_la pensée_**, my little place on the internet where I would like to share my random musings, ideas and thoughts that I find interesting to ponder about. This blog was built partly because I was bored, partly because I was fed up from studying all the time, and mostly because it feels good to put my thoughts out there; after all, it's better than mindlessly scrolling on YouTube.

I have tried my best to maintain a simple and minimalistic design as I want this blog to be a place where I can freely share my thoughts and ideas without any distractions.

Stick around, read a bit, and maybe you'll find something interesting here too.
